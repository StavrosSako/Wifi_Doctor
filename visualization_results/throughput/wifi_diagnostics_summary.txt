Network Diagnosis:
----------------

1. Signal Analysis:
- Signal Quality: Excellent (-29.4 dBm)
- Signal Variation: 85.0 dB (High variation indicates significant client mobility or interference)

2. Network Performance:
- Throughput Efficiency: 455.0% of theoretical maximum
- Current: 728.1 Mbps / Theoretical Max: 160.0 Mbps
- Frame Retry Rate: 2.5% (Normal - good connection quality)

3. Channel Environment:
- Operating on Channel 36
- SNR: 60.5 dB (Excellent - very clean RF environment)
- Noise Floor: -89.9 dBm (Moderate noise level)

4. Overall Assessment:
The network shows suboptimal performance due to high signal variation. These issues suggest client mobility or environmental interference, which are affecting overall network performance.
